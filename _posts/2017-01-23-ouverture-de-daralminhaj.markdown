## السلام عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته

## We have spoken in abundance with the fathers of children who study in various institutions of learning, and their complaints are obvious and include:

* The Institution not fulfilling their curriculum
* Most of the teachers are not qualified to teach their children
* Class sizes are too large so not enough individual attention is given to their child
* The classrooms are unclean and this is harmful to the health of their child

When we saw this we decided to strive to make a change. At Dar-al-Minhaaj our goal is to establish a curriculum and carry it out completely, to make it a reality and not simply ink on paper. We are seeking the assistance of experienced teachers while also reducing the class sizes and paying close attention to the needs of the students and the cleanliness of the classrooms.

**The goal of all of this is to produce a generation that benefits completely from knowledge, and does not find in it any difficulty, and as a result they will be upon the path of the Salaf as Saalih in their understanding, education, and worship.**
